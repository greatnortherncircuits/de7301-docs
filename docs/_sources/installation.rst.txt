++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Plug in Flat Flex Cables to DE7301
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Watch the following video, then continue to read the below instructions.

.. raw:: html

    <iframe id="ytplayer" type="text/html" width="640" height="360"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YdwlRo4nXDk?autoplay=0"

In the next step, you are going to connect the two flex cables to the DE7301. 

The DE7301 utilizes a different flex connector from the IC7300, which includes a locking element to retain the cable. 
The locks must be "pulled up" in order for the flex to be inserted. It may fall down while installing.
After insertion, the locks must be "pushed down" to have the contacts engage and retain the cable. 

Unlike in the video, after installing each flex, perform an inspection. 
Correct insertion of this cable is critical to the safety of your radio

During inspection ensure:

* The cable comes in perpendicular to the connector (Not at an angle).
   * If it is not, the cable was inserted crooked
* Ensure that the length of copper visible on each contact is of equal length.
   * If they are not, the cable may not be fully seated or may be installed at an angle.
* Apply light upward pressure on the flex cable, ensuring it does not dislodge the flex

The short flex, between the Main Board and the DE7301 should look like this:

   :target: ./_static/install_img_large/new_long_flex_de7301_inspection.jpeg


+++++++++++++
Route Cabling
+++++++++++++

Route the ethernet cable in the back through the fan cutout. If you purchased a
cable with the kit, it should fit tightly though the cutout in a single orientation. It may require some wiggling and force, but not excessive.
If you are crimping your own RJ45, route the ethernet cable through the housing and crimp after it is routed.

+++++++++++++++++++++++
Perform Continuity Test
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Find the continuity test pads on the DE7301.
The purpose of the continuity test is to ensure that no pins are shorted.
If you hear a beep, stop! Contact support!
Using a multimeter on the continuity setting, check every pad against every other pad.
The best method to do this is bottom to top, left to right. Start by testing the bottom left pad to radio chassis.

.. warning::

    This is critical, do not skip! This will detect incorrectly installed cables.
    If you hear a beep, stop! Contact support!
