Installation
============

++++++++++++++++++++++
Before you begin
++++++++++++++++++++++

Installation of the DE7301 requires about an hour of time in an ESD safe environment. Before you begin:

* Read through the installation documentation entirely
* Locate a Multimeter with a 'Continuity Beep' function. 
* Locate a JIS (or Phillips) screwdriver
* Locate masking tape (or other low tack tape)



++++++++++++++++++++++
Disclaimer, Warning
++++++++++++++++++++++


By installing this kit, you are taking a risk that you could permanently damage your radio. 

Reasonable attempts have been made to ensure these installation instructions are accurate. 
It is up to you to follow them correctly, and to ensure you perform the continuity test before
powering up your radio.


.. warning::

   If the instructions don't look right, don't make sense, or your radio looks different, STOP! 
   
   Contact support or join the discord. A little time spent asking questions is worth your time.


++++++++++++++++++++++
Remove Bottom Cover
++++++++++++++++++++++

Place your radio on the desk, so that the display is "upside down". Do not move the orentiation of the radio unless instructed to.

Remove the bottom cover of the IC7300 by removing all of the black screws on the bottom and sides of the case

Disconnect Front Panel
++++++++++++++++++++++

Locate the Front Panel SD Card Flat Flex Cable

.. image:: /img/install_img/locate_sd_flex.jpeg
   :target: ./_static/install_img_large/locate_sd_flex.jpeg

Place your index finger on the underside of the rigid blue section of the flex,
and pinch with your thumb on top. In a smooth firm motion, unplug the flex cable from the front panel

Place your index finger along the underside of the flex cable, and pinch with your thumb. In a smooth firm motion, unplug the flex cable from the main board

.. note::

   These connectors have high friction, and will suddenly release.
   Ensure you do not damage anything by allowing the cable to be ripped away during release

++++++++++++++++
Remove top cover
++++++++++++++++

Turn the radio over, ensuring to not damage any loose flat flex cables when changing orientation.

Remove the top cover of the IC7300 by removing all the black screws on the top and sides of the case.

.. note::

   Once the front and back covers are removed, the front panel is no longer secured to the radio body. When moving the radio, support the front panel with your hands.
   Failure to do so may damage cabling from the radio body to the front panel.


Using a piece of low tack tape (Such as masking tape), tape the speaker into place so it does not fall when the radio orentation is later changed.

++++++++++++++++++
Remove front panel
++++++++++++++++++

While holding the front panel, rotate the radio onto it's side. The VFO knob should be down, and the radio main board should be facing you.

   :target: ./_static/install_img_large/front_panel_face_down.jpeg

With one hand, hold the front panel frame.

With the other, place your index finger along the underside of the flex cable, and pinch with your thumb. 

In a smooth firm motion, *pulling straight up*, unplug the flex cable from the front panel. 

.. warning::

   Do not pull the cable at an angle; pull straight up. Pulling at an angle may rip the connector from the display

Once installed, perform an inspection. Correct insertion of this cable is critical.

* The copper contacts are facing towards you.
   * If they are not, the cable is installed backwards
* The cable comes in perpendicular to the connector (Not at an angle).
   * If it is not, the cable was inserted crooked
* Ensure that the length of copper visible on each contact is of equal length.
   * If they are not, the cable may not be fully seated or may be installed at an angle.

Orient the main radio body so that the front of the radio is facing you.
Locate the primary display flex connector

In the parts kit, locate the shorter flat flex cable.
Pinching one end, insert it into the main radio body connector with the shiny copper contacts facing towards your body.
Push gently until you feel the connector bottom out.

Install Retaining Bracket
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. note::

    Bracket is being redesigned to be a single monolithic part, instead of 3 small parts.
    These instructions will change.

Locate "Screw 3" at right side closest to you. Remove this screw, and reinstall with the bracket. Do not overtighten as this may cause the plastic part to yield.

.. image:: /img/install_img/bracket_screw3.jpeg
   :target: ./_static/install_img_large/bracket_screw3.jpeg

Locate "Screw 2" near the middle closest to you. Remove this screw, and reinstall with the bracket. Do not overtighten as this may cause the plastic part to yield.

Install the short flex from the mainboard gooes to the DE7301's "Motherboard" and inspect

Install the long flex from the display goes to the DE7301's "Front Panel", and inspect


.. note::

    The DE7301 utilizes a different flex connector from the IC7300.
    The DE7301 includes locking elements to retain the cable.
    The locks must be pulled up before inserting the flex, and may fall down while installing.
    Once the flex is in place, the locks must be engaged to retain the cable.

+++++++++++++
Route Cabling
+++++++++++++

Route the ethernet cable in the back through the fan cutout. If you purchased a
cable with the kit, it should fit tightly though the cutout in a single orientation.
If you are crimping your own RJ45, route the ethernet cable through the housing and crimp after it is routed.

+++++++++++++++++++++++
Perform Continuity Test
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Find the continuity test pads on the DE7301.
Using a multimeter on the continuity setting, check every pad against every other pad.
The best method to do this is bottom to top, left to right. Start by testing the bottom left pad to radio chassis.

.. warning::

    This is critical, do not skip! This will detect incorrectly installed cables.
